# SpriteKitElements
A small swift framework for attaching additional functionality to any SKNode.  This should be considered experimental, if you would like a more battle tested mechanism I would recommend you check out SpriteKit-Components.

# SpriteElementScene (class)

You must use the custom SKScene sub class SpriteElementScene but you can attach elements to any SKNode without sub classing.

# SpriteElement (protocol)

Implement any of the optional methods in this interface to perform specific actions on a node during its life cycle.
